        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>I make videos and stream primarily World of Tanks-based content. The main goal is to help new or returning players to the game. However, that is not the only content I make. I try and incorporate as many ideas as possible into my videos and streams, even for the more experienced players in the game. This can be anything from 3 marking tanks to just giving tips for the gameplay style of the vehicle.â€‹</p>
